Once upon a time there were three ADJECTIVE pigs. One day, their mother said, "It's time for you to VERB on your own." So they went off to VERB their home. The first built the house out of NOUN. The second buit the house out of NOUN. The third built the house out of NOUN. They were very ADJECTIVE. Then one day a wolf knocked on the first pig's NOUN. Knock, knock, knock. "Open up or I'll VERB your house down." The pig didn't VERB. So the wolf blow down the NOUN.
