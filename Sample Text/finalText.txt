Once upon a time there were three silly pigs. One day, their mother said, "It's time for you to swim on your own." So they went off to simulate their home. The first built the house out of weed. The second buit the house out of leaves. The third built the house out of wood. They were very happy. Then one day a wolf knocked on the first pig's rope. Knock, knock, knock. "Open up or I'll poop your house down." The pig didn't bring. So the wolf blow down the house.
