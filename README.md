# Mad-Libs
This is Mad Libs' practice project from Automate the Boring Stuff with Python, 2nd Edition book.
This program reads an existing text file and whenever the words like ADJECTIVE, VERB, NOUN appear in the text, the program will ask the user to enter a word they like.
Then, the program will write a text file replaced with user words in ADJECTIVE, VERB, NOUN.
The code may not be perfect.
Sample text files are in the Sample Text folder.
100% Python.
